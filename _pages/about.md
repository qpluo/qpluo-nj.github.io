## About me ##

Hi, I am Qiongpeng Luo (first/given name: Qiongpeng; last/family name: Luo; in Chinese characters: 罗琼鹏 (simplified) or 羅瓊鵬 (traditional)). I am a linguist specializing in formal semantics and semantics-syntax interface with special reference to Mandarin Chinese and other languages in China and East Asia within a cross-linguistic perspective. I studied linguistics at Utrecht University from 2007-2008 (under the supervision of Prof. Martin Everaert and the late Tanya Reinhart) and Peking University, from which I obtained my PhD degree in 2009. I worked as a post-doc research fellow at Macquarie Center for Cognitive Science of Macquarie University from 2009-2011 (under Prof. Stephen Crain). Currently I am an associate professor of linguistics at the School of Liberal Arts, Nanjing University, China
